    <delay>1</delay>Computer software engineers, or software developers, design and 
    develop software applications or computer systems. They may develop computer
    applications for clients as well as the major systems that make a computer 
    run. Occasional extended work hours are typical, and travel to meet with 
    other members of design teams might be required. Since much of a computer 
    software engineer's work is done on the computer, telecommuting is often an
    option for this job.

    algorithms and experiments. Data scientists also present their findings and
    propose organizational solutions.
